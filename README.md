# Maya Smith

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Edriena, a self-taught **Full Stack Developer** passionate about building **production-ready web application** using **React, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Tailwind CSS, and Docker**. My background in **Graphic Design and Content Creation** gives me a unique edge: I craft **visually appealing, user-friendly interfaces** while writing ***clean, maintainable code***.

I love taking project from **idea to prototype to deployed app**, from *mini games to fullstack platforms*, and enjoy projects that challenge both my **technical  and creative skills**.

## Tech-Stacks
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Ruby on Rails, REST APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- **DevOps/Deployment**: Docker, containerized workflow, Heroku/Render
